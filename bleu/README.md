# Implement of BLEU in CPP

## Introduction

This part of code is a whole implement of [Papineni, Kishore, Salim Roukos, Todd Ward, and Wei-Jing Zhu. 2002. "BLEU: a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation."](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P02/P02-1040.pdf) in C++11     
Although it is just part of the project of image caption, I make it independant. That means you can just get it and leave the other code of this whole project alone, if you need BLEU score for your own job.      

## Requirements

* C++11   
*I use auto& to iterate through a vector, so C\+\+11 is needed, but it won't be difficult to change it*

## Demo

The project is provided with a demo, in which some examples in the paper are used. You can also see how to use this part of cade through the demo.
